Well the Link in Canvas is broken.

This is what I know about variables
1. They can be changed during a program in a domain that it is defined in.
2. They can be declared publicly or privately
3. You cannot have 2 definitions for 1 variable.
4. You can use the same variable twice with different definitions as long as they are declared privately in separate domains.
